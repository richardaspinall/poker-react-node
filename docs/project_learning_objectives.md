# [Draft] Project Learning Objectives

We have come up with a list of learning objectives for this project, but it's a dynamic ever growing list. If we have something we are wanting to learn currently, then we can add that as an objective and try and come with some work or feature that anchors on the learning objective. For now, we have added them as labels that can be added to tasks and PRs:
